# LibftASM
42 School project. From the subject (also available in french):

> The libftasm project’s goal is to make you code a small library in ASM. You have to recode some of the basic libc function to be able to generate a library. At the end of this project you should be familiar with the language’s syntax, the stack’s operating as well as the compilator’s behavior.
